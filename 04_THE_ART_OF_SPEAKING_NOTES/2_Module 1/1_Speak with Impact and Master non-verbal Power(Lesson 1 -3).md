### Phase 2: Active Notes (During the Session)

#### Notes

#### Lesson 1. How to make a Positive First impression that lasts long
- Element No 1: STYLE
- From the first seconds, We analyse a person and form our attitude towards him
    - Strong or Weak
    - Leader or Outsider
    - Winner or Looser
    - Friend or stranger
 - Two key channels of Influence
    - Auditory: VOICE
    - Visual: BODY

  #### Lesson 2. Pace and Tone of speech
  - Element No 1: STYLE. VOICE: Tempo and tone
  - The Goal is to create a feeling of `EASE` from the first seconds
  - Emotions we need from the first seconds:
    - Positivity (Joy, Acceptance, etc)
    - Trust
    - Respect
    - Interest
  - The pace at which you speak reflects your psychological profile (Your image of you in listeners mind):
  - MAIN THOUGHT - slowly
  - ADDITIONAL THOUGHT - quickly
  - How to build trust from the first seconds:
     - Simple formula: Smooth Pace + low tone
  - The Drozdove Effect
  - The Dolphine Effect: fast and high pitched - Takes away trust and attention in 3 seconds

#### Lesson 3: Pace and tone. Practical exercise
- Exercise: Speech tempo
- Task 1: Read any text for one minute and count how many words you manage to say. This will help determine the speed of your speech
- Task 2: Take a text and read several times. Start slowly, and then gradually increase your speed. This exercise will help you learn to control your speech tempo
- Task 3: Choose an poem and learn it. Read it out load, and simultaneously tap or clap the rhythm
