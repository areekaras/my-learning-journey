## Task 1: Determine Speech Speed
* **Goal:** Find your natural Words Per Minute (WPM) baseline.
* **Exercise:** Read a neutral text for exactly one minute. Count the number of words read. This is your baseline WPM.

---

## Task 2: Control Speech Tempo
* **Goal:** Practice consciously changing your speaking speed.
* **Exercise:** Using a single text, record three versions:
    1.  **Slow Read:** Deliberate, clear, and slower than your baseline.
    2.  **Natural Read:** At your normal baseline WPM.
    3.  **Fast Read:** Quicker than your baseline, energetic but still clear.

## Task 3: Develop Rhythm & Cadence
* **Goal:** Break monotonous speech by connecting words to a physical rhythm.
* **Exercise:**
    1.  Choose a poem with a strong rhythm (e.g., "The Tyger" by William Blake).
    2.  Use an online metronome (start at ~80 BPM).
    3.  Read the poem aloud, tapping or clapping on each beat. Align the stressed syllables of the poem with the beat.

## Core Skill Development: Breaking the Monotone Habit

### 1. The "Emotional Range" Exercise
* **Goal:** Prove the ability to change vocal delivery based on intention.
* **Exercise:** Record one neutral sentence (e.g., "She said she would be here by five.") five times, conveying a different emotion each time: Neutral, Questioning, Annoyed, Excited, Worried.

### 2. The "Vocal Highlighter" Exercise
* **Goal:** Apply vocal variety to a longer piece of text.
* **Exercise:** Read a descriptive paragraph aloud. Beforehand, identify key descriptive words. When reading, use your voice (pitch, pace, volume) to "highlight" these words, making them stand out.

### 3. The "Punctuation Pause" Exercise
* **Goal:** Use punctuation as a guide for professional phrasing and breath control.
* **Exercise:** Read a text aloud, following two rules:
    1.  **Comma (,)**: Take a short, silent "catch-breath."
    2.  **Period (.)**: Take a full, relaxed breath.
