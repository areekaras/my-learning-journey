# Lesson 9: Assembling All Parts of the Speech

This lesson provides the final, assembled structure for your entire speech, combining all the techniques from Module 2 into one logical flow.

## The Proportional Structure (Time Allocation)

As a general rule, your speech should be divided by time as follows:

* **Introduction:** 10-20%
* **Main Part:** 80%
* **Conclusion:** 10-20%

*(Note: The Introduction and Conclusion percentages mean they are 10-20% each, with the Main Part taking the vast majority of the time.)*

## The Complete Speech Blueprint

Here is the full checklist of elements for each section of your speech.

### 1. The Introduction (10-20%)
**Goal: Evoke EMOTIONS**
This is your toolkit for the opening. You may not use every single one in every speech, but this is the full sequence to build from.

* **Entering the stage:** (Walk confidently to your spot)
* **Pause:** (Stand still, make eye contact, command the room)
* **Greeting + question:** (e.g., "Good evening! How's the mood today?")
* **Who am I?** (Your name and brief credibility)
* **Why am I here?** (The audience's purpose, e.g., "Today, I'll show you HOW...")
* **The "WE" frame:** (Establish common ground, e.g., "We've all felt...")
* **The "THREE YES" technique:** (Build agreement with 3 simple, relatable truths)

### 2. The Main Part (80%)
**Goal: Provide LOGIC**
This is the core of your message, built on the Persuasion Algorithm (Lesson 8) and supported by your research (Lesson 7).

1.  **Current Situation (Problem):** State the problem or "Point A."
2.  **Consequence:** Detail the "pain" or negative results of the problem.
    * **Support with:** Your **Research Data** (statistics, facts).
3.  **Solution:** Introduce your key idea or solution.
    * **Support with:** A compelling **Success Story** (yours or someone else's).
    * **Support with:** A powerful **Quote** from an authority.
4.  **Benefit:** Explain the "pleasure" or positive outcome of your solution (Point B).

### 3. The Conclusion (10-20%)
**Goal: Provide MOTIVATION**
This is the final, step-by-step algorithm to end your speech with power.

* **Conclusion (The Summary):** Briefly recap the value (e.g., "Today, you learned...")
* **Your Attitude:** Confidently frame the outcome (e.g., "I'm sure you'll find this useful...")
* **Call to Action:** Give one clear, specific instruction.
* **Gratitude and Farewell:** End with a simple, professional "Thank you."
