# Lesson 4 & 5: The "THREE YES" Technique & Practice

This lesson covers an advanced technique for structuring the beginning of a speech to build rapport and agreement with the audience.

## The Goal of the "THREE YES" Technique
The purpose is to properly set the audience's mindset by leading them through a series of statements they will easily and naturally agree with. By getting them to mentally say "yes" three times, you make them more receptive and open to the core message that follows.

---

### The Four Core Rules

#### 1. Know Your Audience & Use Relatable Topics
To get a "yes," you must make statements that are simple, relatable, and true for your specific audience. Speak their language and use common ground. Don't start with complex or controversial ideas.

#### 2. Avoid Absolute Generalizations
Words like "Everyone" or "All" are dangerous because if even one person in the audience disagrees, you've failed to get a "yes" and may have even created resistance.

* **INCORRECT:** *"Everyone knows that movies are a great escape."* (Someone might think, "I don't, I prefer books.")
* **CORRECT:** *"For many people, watching a movie is a great way to escape for a few hours."*

#### 3. Address *Parts* of the Audience
Instead of generalizing to everyone, make your statements more credible by addressing a portion of the group. This is harder to disagree with.

* **Example Phrases:**
    * *"Most people choose..."*
    * *"There are people who are used to..."*
    * *"Some of us in this room have probably..."*

#### 4. Remove Subjective Opinions (Especially "I")
At the beginning of your speech, do not give your personal evaluation or impose your opinion. The goal is to present objective, agreeable truths, not your personal beliefs. Avoid phrases that signal subjectivity.

* **INCORRECT:** *"I think education is the key to success."*
* **INCORRECT:** *"It seems to me that..."*
* **INCORRECT:** *"I know for sure that..."*

### Summary: Words to Remove
To successfully use this technique, you must strictly avoid words that represent personal opinion or absolute generalization, such as:
* I / Me
* Everyone
* All

## Lesson 5: The "THREE YES" Practice Task

**Task:** Speak for 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) using the "THREE YES" technique on one of the following topics.

**Topics:**
* Movies / Internet / Relationships / Education

**Constraint:** You must **REMOVE** all forbidden words like **I, ME, EVERYONE, ALL, etc.**

### How to Approach the Task (Example)

Let's use the topic **"Internet"**.

**Step 1: Brainstorm three simple, agreeable "YES" statements.**
1.  Access to information has changed dramatically over the last few decades. (Yes, this is a fact).
2.  Today, a vast amount of the world's knowledge is accessible through a device that fits in a pocket. (Yes, this is true).
3.  This connectivity allows people to stay in touch with friends and family across the globe. (Yes, most people would agree).

**Step 2: Build your 90-second speech around these "YES" statements.** Start with your agreeable points and then expand on them, all while avoiding the forbidden words.

**Example Speech Outline:**
> "(Start with YES 1) The way people find information has completely transformed in recent history. Not long ago, research meant a trip to the library, spending hours searching through books."
>
> "(Move to YES 2) Now, a smartphone provides access to a huge portion of collective human knowledge. Answers to complex questions can be found in seconds. This has changed how people learn, work, and solve problems."
>
> "(Move to YES 3) Beyond just data, this global network connects individuals. It allows families to see each other's faces from opposite ends of the world. It helps old friends reconnect after years apart."
>
> "(Expand on the topic) This creates both opportunities and challenges. The skills needed to navigate this digital world are becoming essential. Learning how to tell good information from bad is a critical skill for the modern citizen. The impact on business, on social structures, on politics... it's enormous and continues to evolve every single day..."
