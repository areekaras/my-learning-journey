# Speech Structure

This lesson provides a step-by-step formula for the Introduction and Conclusion, turning your speech structure into a repeatable process for maximum impact.


## The Introduction: A Step-by-Step Algorithm

Your introduction must be a precise sequence of actions designed to capture attention and establish your purpose.

### **Step 1: Entering the Stage**
* **Action:** Walk confidently to the center of the stage or podium. Your preparation is done. Do not adjust your clothing, hair, or notes while walking. Your entire focus should be on the audience.
* **Goal:** To project confidence and readiness from the moment you are seen.

### **Step 2: The Power Pause**
* **Action:** Once you are in position, stop. Stand still and make eye contact with the audience for 3-5 seconds in complete silence.
* **Goal:** This is a crucial non-verbal signal. It commands attention, shows you are in control (not nervous), and makes the audience lean in, ready for your first words.

### **Step 3: Greeting + Simple Engaging Question**
* **Action:** Deliver a warm greeting followed immediately by a simple, low-pressure question.
* **Goal:** To break the silence, create an immediate connection, and identify your "allies" in the audience who are ready to engage.
* **Example:** *"Good morning everyone! (Pause) How's the mood today? (Look for smiles or nods)."*

### **Step 4: Who Am I?**
* **Action:** Briefly and confidently state your name and, if necessary, your role or a single point of credibility. Keep it short.
* **Goal:** To quickly establish your identity so the audience can focus on your message.
* **Example:** *"My name is Mohammed, and I'm a senior iOS engineer."*

### **Step 5: Why Am I Here? (The Audience's Purpose)**
* **Action:** This is the most critical part. You must immediately answer the audience's unspoken question: "What's in it for me?" Frame the speech's benefit *for them*.
* **Goal:** To give the audience a clear reason to listen and to create intrigue.

#### **Techniques:**
* **Focus on THEM:** Use the formula: **"As a result of my speech, you will..."**
* **Create Intrigue:** Use the formula: **"Today, I will show you HOW..."**

#### **Putting It All Together: A Complete Introduction Example**

> (Walks to center stage, pauses, and makes eye contact.)
>
> "Good evening, everyone! (Pause) How are we all feeling tonight?"
>
> "My name is Mohammed, and for the last 8 years, I've been obsessed with one thing: building great software."
>
> "And that's why I'm here. Because **as a result of the next 10 minutes, you will** have a simple, three-step framework to improve your own projects. **Today, I will show you HOW** to turn good code into truly great code."

---

## The Main Part

This is where you deliver the 3 to 5 logical points you planned in Lesson 2. The Introduction has earned you the audience's attention; the Main Part is where you deliver on your promise with structured, logical content.

---

## The Conclusion: The Final Algorithm

Your conclusion should be a clear, confident sequence that leaves a lasting impression and motivates the audience.

### **Step 1: Summarize the Value**
* **Action:** Start with a simple phrase that recaps what the audience has gained.
* **Goal:** To remind them of the value they received.
* **Example:** *"So today, you learned the three essential principles of great code..."*

### **Step 2: Form Your Attitude (Confident Framing)**
* **Action:** Program the audience's response with confident language. Avoid weak words like "I hope."
* **Goal:** To reinforce the value of your message and project authority.
* **CORRECT:** *"I'm **sure** you found these techniques useful."*
* **INCORRECT:** *"<del>I hope</del> you liked my speech."*

### **Step 3: The Call to Action (CTA)**
* **Action:** Give a clear, direct, and simple instruction on what you want the audience to do next. Deliver it with a confident voice.
* **Goal:** To provide motivation and a clear next step.
* **Example:** *"So my challenge to you is simple: Tomorrow morning, when you open your project, pick just **one** of these principles and apply it. That's it."*

### **Step 4: Gratitude and Farewell**
* **Action:** End with a simple, sincere thank you.
* **Goal:** To close the presentation professionally and warmly.
* **Example:** *"Thank you for your attention."*

#### **Putting It All Together: A Complete Conclusion Example**

> "**So today, you learned how** to use documentation, testing, and refactoring to elevate your work. **I'm sure you'll find** that applying even one of these will make a huge difference in your projects."
>
> "**So my call to action for you is this:** When you get to work tomorrow, just choose one function and write a single unit test for it. Start small."
>
> "**Thank you.**"
