# Lesson 6: The "WE" Frame Technique

This lesson introduces an advanced technique to build a strong connection with your audience by shifting your language from an "I vs. You" perspective to a collective "We."

## The Core Concept: Everyone has a Different "Map"

The main mistake beginner speakers make is assuming the audience thinks the same way they do. The reality is that every person has their own unique perspective, or "map of the world." The "WE" frame is a powerful tool to bridge these individual maps.

## The Goal: Find Common Ground

The objective of this technique is to create a common, safe space with the audience. You achieve this by focusing on shared experiences, identities, goals, or challenges that unite you and them.

* **Example:** When speaking to students, you can find common ground in topics like education, learning, exams, or future careers.

## Why Use the "WE" Frame?

Using inclusive language like "we" and "us" has several key benefits:

* **Connects with the audience:** It instantly creates a sense of shared identity and rapport.
* **Reduces rejection of information:** When you present an idea as something "we" believe or face, it's less likely to be immediately dismissed.
* **Lowers the chances of "difficult" participants:** It's harder for an individual to be combative when they feel they are part of a collective group you are addressing.
* **It's harder to argue within the "WE" frame:** It shifts the dynamic from a one-on-one debate to a group understanding.

## The Task: Creating a Common Space

Your practical task is to consciously use language that creates this shared space.

#### **Examples from the Course:**

* *"For **us**, the residents of the capital..."* (Shared location)
* *"**We** all remember that..."* (Shared memory or historical event)
* *"**We've** all been students..."* (Shared past experience)
* *"**We've** been waiting for this together for a long time..."* (Shared anticipation)

#### **More Practical Examples:**

* **In a company meeting:** *"As a team, **we've** faced some tough challenges this quarter, and **we're** all looking for ways to improve."* (Establishes a shared struggle and goal).
* **At a tech conference:** *"**We're** all here today because **we** are passionate about technology and what **we** can build with it."* (Establishes a shared passion).

## The Ultimate Example: The President's Speech

An ideal (and difficult) example of the "WE" frame is a New Year's speech by a president. The speaker must find a way to touch upon the different realities and lives of millions of diverse people (farmers, students, doctors, etc.) and unite them all under a single, hopeful "we." This shows the skill required to use this technique at the highest level.
