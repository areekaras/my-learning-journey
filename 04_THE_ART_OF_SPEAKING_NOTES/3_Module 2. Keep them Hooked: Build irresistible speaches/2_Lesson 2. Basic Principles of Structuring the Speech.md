# Lesson 2: Basic Principles of Structuring a Speech

This lesson covers the fundamental three-part structure of any effective speech. The core idea is to guide the audience on a journey from emotion, through logic, to a final sense of motivation.

## 1. Choosing a Topic
The best way to select a topic is to frame it as a question or an assumption that creates **Interest + Intrigue**.

* **Examples:**
    * *Why do people want to practice yoga?*
    * *Does school kill creativity?*
    * *Is going on a date at 30 easy or hard?*


## 2. The Basic Speech Structure

Every speech is built on three key parts, each with a distinct goal:

* **Introduction** -> The Goal is **EMOTIONS**
* **Main Part** -> The Goal is **LOGIC**
* **Conclusion** -> The Goal is **MOTIVATION**


### **The Introduction: Evoke EMOTIONS**
The first 10 seconds are critical. Your goal is to connect with the audience on an emotional level and grab their attention.

#### **Techniques to Use:**

* **Sincerity:** Express your genuine feelings about the topic.
    * **Example:** *"I'm truly honored to speak with you today, as this topic is something I'm incredibly passionate about personally."*

* **Compliment the Audience:** Acknowledge and appreciate them.
    * **Example:** *"It's wonderful to see so many dedicated people here tonight, ready to learn and grow."*

* **Interesting Fact:** Start with a surprising statistic or a "Did you know?" question.
    * **Example:** *"Did you know that the average person will spend over 90,000 hours at work in their lifetime? That's why making those hours meaningful is so important."*

* **A Question (or Series of Questions):** Directly engage the audience and make them think.
    * **Example:** *"How many of you have ever felt nervous before a big presentation? Now, how many of you wish you had a tool to turn that nervousness into confidence?"*

* **"One of Us" / Common Ground:** Highlight something that unites you with the audience.
    * **Example:** *"Like many of you, I've lived in this city my whole life, and I've seen firsthand how our community is changing."*


### **The Main Part: Provide LOGIC**
Once you have their emotional attention, you must deliver your message with clear, rational arguments.

#### **Key Principles:**

* **The Rule of Three (or Five):** Break your main message down into **3 to 5 logical points**. This makes your content structured and easy for the audience to remember.

* **Balance Logic and Emotion:** While the main part focuses on logic, the arguments you choose should resonate with your audience. The course notes suggest a general guide:
    * Use more **LOGIC** for audiences concerned with status, business, or in morning sessions.
    * Use more **EMOTIONS** for general audiences, women, children, the elderly, or in evening sessions.

#### **Practical Example (Topic: Why Networking is Crucial):**
1.  **Point 1 (Logic):** It opens doors to new career opportunities. (Provide statistics/facts).
2.  **Point 2 (Logic/Emotion):** It helps you solve problems faster by connecting you with experts. (Share a personal story).
3.  **Point 3 (Emotion):** It builds a support system of people who can offer advice and encouragement. (Talk about community).


### **The Conclusion: Provide MOTIVATION**
If you've done your job well, the audience is now thinking, "Okay, I'm convinced. What's next?" Your conclusion must answer this question.

#### **The Core Technique:**

* **Make a CALL TO ACTION (CTA):** This is the single most important part of your conclusion. Tell your audience exactly what you want them to **do**, **think**, or **feel** after your speech. This applies even if it's a lecture.

#### **Practical Examples:**
* **Direct Action:** *"So tonight, I challenge each of you to take out your phone, find one person you haven't spoken to in a year, and send them a message to reconnect."*
* **A Change in Thinking:** *"The next time you feel that fear of public speaking, I want you to remember that it's just energy. Your job is to turn it into excitement."*
* **Inspirational:** *"Let's leave here today committed to being leaders who listen first. That is how we will build a better team."*
