# Lesson 10: Practical Speech Examples (3 Cases)

Here are three full 4-minute speech scripts, built using the complete blueprint from your course.

---

## Case Nº1: The Mayoral Candidate (4-Minute Speech)

- **Role:** You are running for mayor.
- **Audience:** Citizens in your city.
- **Goal:** Address current issues and present your new project to win votes.

---

### **The Speech**

**(You walk confidently to the center of the stage, plant your feet, and make eye contact.)**

**[L3 - Pause]:** (You wait 3 full seconds in silence, looking at the audience.)

**[L3 - Greeting + Question]:** "Good evening, everyone. (Pause) Let me ask you a simple question: Are you truly happy with your daily commute?"

**[L4 - The "THREE YES" Technique]:**
1.  "Most of us who live here... we love our city's energy, don't we? We love the opportunities." (The audience mentally says 'Yes')
2.  "But we also know that deep frustration of being stuck in gridlock traffic, just trying to get home." (Yes)
3.  "And many of us are worried, watching our air quality get worse and our green spaces disappear." (Yes)

**[L6 - The "WE" Frame]:** "These aren't separate issues. These are challenges **we** all face, every single day. This is *our* city, and **we** are all in this together."

**[L3 - Who Am I?]:** "My name is [Your Name], and I'm not just a politician; I'm a 20-year resident of this city. My children go to school here."

**[L3 - Why Am I Here?]:** "That's why I'm running for mayor. **Today, I will show you HOW** we can solve our city's biggest problems with one single, bold project. **As a result of these 4 minutes, you** will see a clear path to a cleaner, faster, and greener city for all of us."

**[L8 - Main Part: Problem]:** "For the past decade, our city's leadership has been stuck. They see congestion as the problem. But congestion is just a *symptom*. The real problem is a total lack of imagination and a failure to build a modern, connected public transport system."

**[L8 - Consequence]:** "And what are the consequences of this failure? It's not just lost time. It's a real public health crisis. **[L7 - Research Data]** A recent city report showed our air pollution levels are 30% above the national safety guidelines. This isn't just a number; it affects our children's health. It affects our own health. It is unacceptable."

**[L8 - Solution]:** "That's why today, I am proposing 'The Green Grid.' It's a simple, two-part plan. First, we will build a network of dedicated, high-speed electric bus lanes that will be faster and more reliable than any car. Second, we will use the reclaimed road space to create a new 'grid' of protected bike paths and community parks."

**[L8 & L7 - Success Story/Quote]:** "This isn't a fantasy. Look at the city of Curitiba, in Brazil. They faced the exact same problems we do. They implemented a similar system, and **to quote** their visionary mayor, Jaime Lerner, they proved that 'the city is not the problem, the city is the solution.' They are now one of the greenest, most livable cities on Earth."

**[L8 - Benefit]:** "The benefit for *you* is simple: a 20-minute-shorter commute. Cleaner air for your families to breathe. Green, safe parks for your children to play in. 'The Green Grid' isn't just an infrastructure project; it's a project for a better quality of life."

**[L3 - Conclusion (Summary)]:** "**Today, you've learned how** 'The Green Grid' can solve our traffic, pollution, and community problems all at once."

**[L3 - Your Attitude]:** "**I am sure** you can see that this is a practical, achievable plan that puts our health and our families first."

**[L3 - Call to Action]:** "So my call to action is this: Go to GreenGrid.com. See the plan for yourself. Talk to your neighbors. And on election day, don't just vote for a person. Vote for the future **we** all deserve."

**[L3 - Gratitude and Farewell]:** "**Thank you.**"

## Case Nº2: The YouTube Channel (4-Minute Speech)

- **Role:** You have created a personal growth YouTube channel.
- **Audience:** Potential viewers/subscribers.
- **Goal:** Present your project and get them to watch.

---

### **The Speech**

**(You stand in front of the camera, looking directly into the lens. You smile.)**

**[L3 - Pause]:** (You start the video with 2 seconds of silence, just smiling, to create intrigue.)

**[L3 - Greeting + Question]:** "Hi everyone. Let me ask you a question: Have you ever felt like you're not living up to your full potential?"

**[L4 - The "THREE YES" Technique]:**
1.  "Most of us have big goals we want to achieve. We want to be healthier, or learn a new skill, or be more confident." (Yes)
2.  "But it's so easy to feel overwhelmed by all the 'life-changing' advice out there, isn't it?" (Yes)
3.  "And trying to do everything at once often just leads to burnout, making us feel worse than when we started." (Yes)

**[L6 - "WE" Frame]:** "**We've** all been in that cycle. **We** start strong, we fail, and then we quit."

**[L3 - Who Am I?]:** "My name is [Your Name], and for years, I was the king of burnout, trapped in that exact same cycle."

**[L3 - Why Am I Here?]:** "That's why I started this channel. **Today, I'm going to show you HOW** I broke that cycle with one simple idea. **As a result of these 4 minutes, you** will discover a simpler, more effective way to make personal growth a permanent part of your life."

**[L8 - Main Part: Problem]:** "The problem with the personal growth industry is that it's built on an all-or-nothing mindset. It floods us with 10-step plans and 'miracle morning routines' that demand we change our entire lives overnight."

**[L8 - Consequence]:** "The consequence is that we give up. We start to believe that real change is too hard, or that maybe **we** just don't have the self-discipline for it. **[L7 - Research Data]** In fact, studies from the University of Scranton show that 92% of people who set New Year's resolutions... fail. The problem isn't the goal; it's the method."

**[L8 - Solution]:** "This YouTube channel, 'The 1% Rule,' is the solution. It's built on one simple idea: **small steps, done consistently.**"

**[L7 - Quote / My Story]:** "Instead of 'reading 50 books a year,' **we** start by reading one page a day. Instead of 'meditating for an hour,' **we** start with one minute. **We** are applying the wisdom of the proverb, **'A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.'** This is how I finally learned to code, got in shape, and built this channel."

**[L8 - Benefit]:** "The benefit of this approach is that *it works*. It's a system designed to build momentum, not burnout. By subscribing to this channel, you're not just getting tips; you're joining a community of people who are making real, sustainable progress. You're proving that you can achieve any goal, one percent at a time."

**[L3 - Conclusion (Summary)]:** "**Today, you've learned** about this channel and a method that exchanges overwhelming pressure for simple, daily consistency."

**[L3 - Your Attitude]:** "**I am sure** you will find that this one-step-at-a-time approach is the missing piece you've been looking for."

**[L3 - Call to Action]:** "So my call to action is this: After this video, don't subscribe. Instead, just pick one video from my channel that interests you. Watch that one, 5-minute video. That can be your '1%' for today."

**[L3 - Gratitude and Farewell]:** "I'm excited to see what **we** can build together. **Thank you for watching.**"

## Case Nº3: The Nobel Prize Winner (4-Minute Speech)

- **Role:** Self-taught scientist, Nobel laureate.
- **Audience:** Academics, public, aspiring thinkers.
- **Goal:** Inspire with the topic "Every person has the potential of a genius."

---

### **The Speech**

**(You walk to the grand podium, arrange your single note card, and pause, taking in the audience.)**

**[L3 - Pause]:** (You wait for 5 full seconds. The room is silent.)

**[L3 - Greeting + Question]:** "Good afternoon. (Pause) What do you think of when you hear the word 'genius'?"

**[L4 - The "THREE YES" Technique]:**
1.  "For most people, it brings to mind a very specific image... someone like an Einstein, a Mozart... a person born with a rare, divine gift." (Yes)
2.  "And because of this, many of us look at our own abilities and think, 'Well, that's not me.'" (Yes)
3.  "This belief often creates a fear of failure, a fear that stops us from pursuing our most curious and unconventional ideas." (Yes)

**[L6 - "WE" Frame]:** "**We** have been taught to put 'genius' on a pedestal, making it something separate from us."

**[L3 - Who Am I?]:** "My name is [Your Name]. And I stand before you today to accept this incredible honor. But I must be honest: I was not a child prodigy. I have no formal degrees in this field. I am, by all definitions, a self-taught scientist who works in a garage."

**[L3 - Why Am I Here?]:** "That is why I am here. **Today, I will show you HOW** we can reclaim the word 'genius.' **As a result of this speech, you** will no longer see genius as a gift for the few, but as a potential that lives inside every single one of us."

**[L8 - Main Part: Problem]:** "The problem is that our society defines 'genius' as a final *result*—the finished painting, the brilliant theory, the Nobel Prize."

**[L8 - Consequence]:** "The consequence of this mistake is that **we** devalue the *process*. **We** hide our failures. **We** discourage tinkering and experimentation. **[L7 - Research Data]** But studies on creativity consistently show that the single biggest killer of innovation is not a lack of talent, but a crippling fear of being wrong."

**[L8 - Solution]:** "The solution is to change our definition. 'Genius' is not the result. 'Genius' is a *process*. It is the simple act of being relentlessly curious. It is the willingness to be wrong a thousand times. It is the perseverance to connect ideas that no one else has thought to connect."

**[L8 & L7 - My Success Story]:** "My discovery, the one you are honoring me for, did not come in a flash of brilliance. It came after five straight years of failed experiments. It came from reading forgotten research papers from the 1950s and asking a 'stupid' question that every expert in the field had stopped asking. My 'genius' was not in finding the right answer; it was in being foolish enough to keep looking for it."

**[L8 & L7 - Quote]:** "As Thomas Edison, another innovator who was famously self-taught, said, **'Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.'**"

**[L8 - Benefit]:** "The benefit of this new definition is that it is *empowering*. It means that genius is not something you *are*; it is something you *do*. It means the potential for genius exists in every person in this room who is willing to be curious and willing to persevere."

**[L3 - Conclusion (Summary)]:** "**Today, you have learned** that 'genius' is not a title, but a habit of relentless, passionate curiosity."

**[L3 - Your Attitude]:** "**I am sure** you can feel the truth in this: that you, too, have that spark of curiosity within you."

**[L3 - Call to Action]:** "So my call to action is this: When you leave here, find one 'stupid' question that you are deeply curious about... and give yourself permission to chase it. That is where genius begins."

**[L3 - Gratitude and Farewell]:** "**Thank you.**"
