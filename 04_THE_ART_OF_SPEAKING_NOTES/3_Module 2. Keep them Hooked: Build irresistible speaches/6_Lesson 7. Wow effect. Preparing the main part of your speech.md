# Lesson 7: Preparing the Main Part of the Speech

This lesson focuses on the practical steps for researching and drafting the main part of your speech, ensuring it is logical, informative, and credible.

## The Role of the Main Part: A Quick Recap
The main part is the core of your presentation. Its purpose is to provide the **LOGIC** that supports your introduction's emotional hook. It must:
* Give a full disclosure of the topic.
* Be the most informative section.
* Be clearly divided into **3 to 5 logical sections** or points.

## The Four-Step Process for Gathering Information

To build a strong main part, you need to gather compelling content. Follow these four steps to find the right materials.

### Step 1: Find Interesting Facts
* **Action:** Research your topic to find several surprising or thought-provoking facts. These are great for grabbing attention and making your points memorable.
* **Example (Topic: The Importance of Reading):** *"Did you know that reading for just 6 minutes can reduce stress by up to 68%? That makes it more effective than listening to music or even taking a walk."*

### Step 2: Use Statistics and Research
* **Action:** Find **1 or 2 relevant studies** or key statistics to support your arguments. Numbers add authority and make your points more concrete.
* **Important:** Don't overdo it. Flooding the audience with too many numbers can be confusing.
* **Example (Topic: The Importance of Reading):** *"A long-term study by the Yale University School of Public Health found that people who read books for at least 30 minutes a day lived, on average, almost two years longer than non-readers."*

### Step 3: Use Authoritative Sources
* **Action:** Ensure the information you present comes from credible and authoritative sources. This builds trust with your audience.
* **Example:** Citing information from well-respected institutions (like universities, scientific journals, or industry experts) adds weight to your claims.

### Step 4: Reference Authoritative and Famous Individuals
* **Action:** Weave in stories, quotes, and examples from people. This connects your logical points to real-world human experience.
* **Types of References:**
    * **Quotes:** A relevant quote can summarize a key idea powerfully.
        * **Example:** *"To quote the writer George R.R. Martin, 'A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies... The man who never reads lives only one.'"*
    * **Success Stories (1 Story is Enough):** Share a brief story about someone who succeeded, relating it to your topic.
        * **Example:** *"Consider the story of Oprah Winfrey, who often speaks about how books were her 'pass to personal freedom' and a crucial tool in overcoming a difficult childhood."*
    * **Your Own Life Story:** A personal anecdote is one of the most powerful ways to build connection and prove a point.
        * **Example:** *"I used to struggle with focus until I started a daily reading habit. I can tell you from my own experience that it fundamentally changed my ability to concentrate on complex tasks at work."*


## Bringing It All Together: Writing the Draft

Once you have gathered your facts, statistics, and stories, it's time to work.

Your goal is to organize this collected information into your **3 to 5 main sections**. Each section should represent a key argument, supported by the credible and engaging content you've found.
