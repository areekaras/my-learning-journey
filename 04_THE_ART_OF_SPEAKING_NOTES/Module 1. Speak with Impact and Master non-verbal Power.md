#### Notes

#### Lesson 1: How to make a Positive First impression that lasts long
- Element No 1: STYLE
- From the first second, We analyse a person and form our attitude towards him
    - Strong or Weak
    - Leader or Outsider
    - Winner or Looser
    - Friend or stranger
 - Two key channels of Influence
    - Auditory: VOICE
    - Visual: BODY

  #### Lesson 2: Pace and Tone of speech
  - Element No 1: STYLE. VOICE: Tempo and tone
  - The Goal is to create a feeling of `EASE` from the first seconds
  - Emotions we need from the first seconds:
    - Positivity (Joy, Acceptance, etc)
    - Trust
    - Respect
    - Interest
  - The pace at which you speak reflects your psychological profile (Your image of you in listeners mind):
  - MAIN THOUGHT - slowly
  - ADDITIONAL THOUGHT - quickly
  - How to build trust from the first seconds:
     - Simple formula: Smooth Pace + low tone
  - The Drozdove Effect
  - The Dolphine Effect: fast and high pitched - Takes away trust and attention in 3 seconds
