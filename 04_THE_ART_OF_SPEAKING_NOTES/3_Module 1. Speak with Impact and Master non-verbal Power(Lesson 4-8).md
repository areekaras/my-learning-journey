#### Notes

#### Lesson 4: Intonation & How to use in communication
- ELEMENT No. 1: STYLE. VOICE - intonation
- Monotony is the number one enemey of any speaker
- It kills the attention in 5 seconds
- Intonation in the first sentence can identify an inexperienced speaker
- The secret to confidence in your voice is - `INTONATION FALLING` at the end of a sentence or main thought

#### Lesson 6. Body language of a confident speaker
- ELEMENT No. 1: STYLE. BODY - power pose
- Our body influences:
    1. Ourselves, when we speak and communicate
    2. The listeners
- Action -> State
- A straight back posture - 100% strength of the voice!
- The body says:
    - Distribute the centre of gravity
    - Take a small step forward
    - Lean the torso

#### Lesson 7. Gestures: 5 basic principles of using gestures in communication
- ELEMENT No. 1: STYLE. BODY - Gestures
- Practice: Show below words with Gestures
    - "The income of our company has been growing year by year!"
    - "The results were below expectaions."
    - "We are planning to expand the company soon."
    - "Thank you very much for coming today."
    - "Success is inevitable for us."
    - "We started from humble beginnings, and now we have acheived the highest results."
    - "On one side of the scale was career, on the other - money."
 
#### Lesson 8. Practice confident body language
- ELEMENT No. 1: STYLE. BODY - Gestures
- Rules of Gesturing
    1. Be natural: Don't try to play a role that is not true to your nature.
    2. Don't gesture lower than your waist.
    3. Don't gesture higher than your head, unless you are at a stadium.
         - IMPORTANT!
           The higher the gesture, the more emotional it is.
           It's normal for women to gesture around the chest area.
           Men gesture at the level of the stomach, which gives
           WEIGHT to their words.

    4. WAVE - The movement start from the elbow and is done smoothly.
         - **The gesture - soft hand, then a point.**
         - **One-on-one** - gestures with wrists.
         - **Small group** - use your elbows.
         - **Large audience** - gestures from the shoulder.
    5. **Draw images with your hand** - become an artist and don't be afraid to outline the images your are talking about.
    6. **Freedom for the elbows!** - Fear lives in the shoulder gridle, which makes the torso looks tense.
    7. **From heart to heart** - Imagine a light of beam coming from your chest, and you are redirecting it to your audience, helping with your hands.
