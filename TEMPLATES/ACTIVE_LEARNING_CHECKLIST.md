# The Active Learning Checklist

> A repeatable system for every study session to ensure knowledge is deep, permanent, and easy to communicate.

---

### Phase 1: Before the Session (5-Min Setup)
*This phase primes your brain for learning.*

- [ ] **Set Goal:** State one clear, specific goal for this session.
- [ ] **Set Environment:** Phone off/away. Unrelated browser tabs closed. Water ready.
- [ ] **Prime Brain:** Briefly review the summary from the last session on this topic (2 mins).

---

### Phase 2: During the Session (Deep Work)
*This phase is about active engagement, not passive consumption.*

- [ ] **Engage, Don't Transcribe:** Take minimal notes. Focus on the core ideas, not sentences.
- [ ] **Embrace the Struggle:** Attempt problems on your own for 15-20 mins before seeking hints. The struggle is where learning happens.
- [ ] **Ask Deeper Questions (Your Note-Taking Guide):** Your notes should be answers to these questions:
    - **What specific problem does this solve?**
      > e.g., "The Two Pointers pattern efficiently finds pairs in a *sorted* array."
    - **How does this connect to what I already know?**
      > e.g., "This is an optimization over the brute-force nested loop method."
    - **What are the key trade-offs or edge cases?**
      > e.g., "The main trade-off is the initial cost of sorting the array."
    - **How would I explain this to a beginner?**
      > e.g., "Imagine two pointers, one at each end of a sorted list, moving towards each other."

### Phase 3: After the Session (Consolidation)
*This is the most important phase. **Do not skip it.***

- [ ] **Step 1: Create Summary (Feynman Technique):**
    - Close all materials. From memory alone, write a simple summary or draw a diagram of the concept. This act of retrieval is what builds long-term memory.

- [ ] **Step 2: Teach-Back (Communication Practice):**
    - Stand up. Set a 60-second timer.
    - Explain the concept from your summary out loud. This trains your ability to structure your thoughts and speak clearly.

- [ ] **Step 3: Schedule Spaced Repetition:**
    - **Daily:** Add a 5-min task for tomorrow: `Review [Concept Name] Summary`.
    - **Weekly:** Add this summary to your list for the **"Weekly Knowledge Review"** session on Sunday.
