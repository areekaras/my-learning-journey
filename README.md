# My Public Learning Journey

> This repository documents my focused, three-month journey (Sep-Dec 2025) to deepen my craft as a Senior Mobile Engineer. This is a public log of my process, challenges, and insights, guided by the principles of active learning and consistency.

---

## 🎯 The Mission

The goal of this journey is to systematically master the skills and communication required for the next level of my career. The focus is on deep, foundational knowledge over surface-level familiarity.

---

## 🏛️ The Pillars of Study

This journey is structured around two core pillars, pursued in parallel:

1.  **🧠 Deepening the Craft:** Focused study on the non-negotiable fundamentals of modern mobile engineering, including advanced iOS architecture, data structures & algorithms, and system design.
2.  **🗣️ Mastering Communication:** Deliberate practice in communicating complex technical ideas clearly and concisely through writing and speaking.

---

## 🧠 The Learning Philosophy

-   **Active Learning:** Knowledge is built through active creation (summarizing, teaching), not passive consumption. Every session follows a strict "Before, During, After" checklist.
-   **Consistency over Intensity:** This is a sustainable marathon, not a burnout sprint. The goal is to show up every day and follow the system.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus: Sprint 7 (Sep 8 - Sep 21)

My progress is tracked in biweekly sprints. Work for each sprint is done on a branch (e.g., `sprint-7`) and merged at the end of the cycle.

**This Sprint's Goals:**
- Get on track with the iOS Essential Developer course.
- Solve 3 problems in AlgoExpert.
- Learn at least one concept in System Design.
- Get on track with "The Art of Speaking" course.
