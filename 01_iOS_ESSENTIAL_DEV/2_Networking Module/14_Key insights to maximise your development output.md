# Maximizing Development Output

### Before You Start Coding

-   **Gather Information First**: Understand the requirements before writing code. Collaborate with business and product teams to define features.
-   **Focus on Small Iterations**: Deliver customer value in small steps to get fast feedback and improve iteratively.
-   **Participate in Planning**: As a developer, join customer research and planning sessions to provide technical expertise and create achievable goals.
-   **Draft a Quick Design**: Create a rough architecture diagram (in under 10 minutes) as an initial guide. It’s okay to skip this and let the design evolve if you're unsure.

### During the Development Process

-   **Follow a Test-First Approach**: Use automated tests (TDD) to validate requirements and provide the confidence to move quickly. Ensure tests are precise and decoupled from implementation details.
-   **Solve the Problem, Don't Fit a Pattern**: Focus on solving your specific challenges using principles like **separation of concerns** and **dependency inversion**. Don't force your code into a named architecture (e.g., MVVM, VIPER).
-   **Automate with CI**: Set up a Continuous Integration pipeline to speed up code merges and ensure the main branch is always stable. This, combined with modularity, enables independent parallel development.
