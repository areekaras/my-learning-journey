### Phase 1: Preparation Checklist (Before the Session)
*The setup for effective deep work.*

- [x] **Goal Set:** My specific goal for this session is Understand BDD, TDD, Use cases, Architecture and Modular design
- [x] **Environment Ready:** Phone is off/away, and my workspace is distraction-free.
- [x] **Brain Primed:** I have completed a 2-minute review of the previous related topic.

### Phase 2: Active Notes (During the Session)
*My structured notes, guided by deep questions.*

- [x] **Embrace the Struggle:** Attempt problems on your own for 15-20 mins before seeking hints.

#### Notes
- An architecture solves the problem at hand
- It should solve the problem in a well and elegant form
- Good system design starts with good requirements
- Good requirements leads to increase the chances of building better software
- Bad system design starts with bad assumbptions (bad communications)
- Good software design balances the trade offs of solving the current problems while welcoming changes
- Good architecture is a form of good communication
- In a functional team, everyone holds each other accountable for good results
- BDD is a nice way of gathering relavant information via conversations
- BDD can be more effective when we focus on meaningful discussions instead of tools (or even testing)
- As a developer, It is our job to help the business to understand the technical challenges.
- Use cases is an algorithmic view of what the system is doing
- A use case is agnostic of delivery mechanisms
- A use case encapsulates app-specific business rules
