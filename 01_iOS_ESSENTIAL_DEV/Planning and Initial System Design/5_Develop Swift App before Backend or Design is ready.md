### Phase 1: Preparation Checklist (Before the Session)
*The setup for effective deep work.*

- [x] **Goal Set:** My specific goal for this session is `Understand how to develop swift Apps before Backend/Design is ready`
- [x] **Environment Ready:** Phone is off/away, and my workspace is distraction-free.
- [x] **Brain Primed:** I have completed a 2-minute review of the previous related topic.

---

### Phase 2: Active Notes (During the Session)
*My structured notes, guided by deep questions.*

- [ ] **Embrace the Struggle:** Attempt problems on your own for 15-20 mins before seeking hints.

#### Notes
- Set up an contract with backend and design team 
- With an initial contract, teams can start independently
- Careful with the Silos-Keep the communication open
- Create Model Specs
- Define Payload Contract
- Create macOS framework for UI(or platform) agnostic modules to expedite the development and testing processes as we dont need to run the app nor our tests on the slow iOS simulator

### Phase 3: Proof of Learning (After the Session)
*This is where the knowledge becomes permanent. This section is completed from memory.*

#### My "Blank Page" Summary (Feynman Technique)
