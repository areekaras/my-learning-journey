#### Notes
 - Zoom out from component level view of the system to how organize it into modules.
 - Understand how coupled or modular a system from its diagrams.
 - We can have monolith design where everything can be inside same module.
 - but as long we are following good principles, it is easily movable to separate modules and testable
 - As a developer or risk manager, we shouldn't be looking for a one-to-rule-them-all kind of a solution(it doesn't exist); intead, we can tailer a solutions based on the available resources and requirements.
